## Story

People Always Talk About The Weather...

They are also always checking the weather in native and web applications.

This application allows you, as a user to enter a city name (and be gently helped by an autocomplete in selecting it), and see the specific weather in that city. 

It provides a 5-day Forecast and you can also add a specific place to your favorite list.

It has a pleasing UI/UX, that blends in an photo from the city with the rest of the application.
